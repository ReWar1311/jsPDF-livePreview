# jsPDF-livePreview
Shows live preview of pdf while writing the code, added grids and auto run code for a better UX and ease.(A code-editor for jsPDF library)

While working with a project, I had too generate pdfs, but I was totally embarrased of fixing small anomalities or design with downloading the pdf each time.
So I created thisâ˜º.

#code:
-Used monaco-editor as the code editor.
-Added custom commands in suggestions of monaco-editor for jsPDF.
-Used blob to open pdf in browser's pdf-viewer without downloading
-Used Codepan template for Select optons(https://codepen.io/mrphang/pen/XWxKdpV).
-Used getCSSSCAN template for checkbox(https://getcssscan.com/css-checkboxes-examples).


#features:
 -Shows preview of generated pdf side-by-side.
 -Added auto-run code option for live preview and also shows error alert in jsPDF code if button is used.
 -Added grids with custom color and spacing for better control over preview.
 -Custamized suggestions according to the jsPDF.

 Next(if worked on it) =>{Integrate AI prompt-bar to auto-write jsPDF code by giving a prompt}

I am glad if you are reading this :) 
And will more glad if you will contribute (even a suggestion).Rest is on You.
